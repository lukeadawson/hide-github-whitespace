# Hide GitHub Whitespace: Chrome Extension

GitHub does not inherently offer an option to globally hide or ignore whitespace. This tool automatically hides the whitespace in your GitHub pull requests.

## Installation in Development Mode

You can install and run the extension in Development Mode. This enables you to test out changes and updates before they're released. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. **Clone or download the repository** to your local machine.

2. Open Chrome, then go to `chrome://extensions/`. This will bring up the Extensions page.

3. On the Extensions page, look for the **'Developer Mode' toggle** in the upper-right corner. Switch this on.

4. Once Developer Mode is enabled, you'll see additional options. Click **'Load Unpacked'**.

5. In the dialogue that appears, **navigate to the directory** where you saved the cloned or downloaded repository, then click 'Select'. This directory should contain a `manifest.json` file.

6. Chrome will install the extension in Development Mode, and it will appear in your list of extensions. You'll know it's in Development Mode if it has a 'Reload' button underneath.

You're now ready to use the "Hide GitHub Whitespace" extension in Development Mode. Remember, any time you make changes to the extension's files, you must click 'Reload' on the Extensions page for the changes to take effect.
